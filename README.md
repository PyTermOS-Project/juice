JuicePackage or Juice is a package manager creater for minimal applications like PMDMcalc or installing new lightweight apps.

It is built in to PyTermOS, and can be installed on macOS.

Only thing you need is, Python on macOS and the newest version of Juice for PyTermOS.

## juicy development
JuicyDevelopment is a JuicyService that can upload your apps to Juice.

## juice use
JuiceUse is a service, pre-installed to JuicePackage, for easier use. Like in juice plus [package].

## so much juice
JuicePackage is built in with many features like JuicyDevelopment or JuiceUse, which makes JuicePackage so juicy.

### sorry
Juice is still in development, so PyTermOS is. You can contribute, so it will be ready faster.
