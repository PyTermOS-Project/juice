JuicePackage or Juice is a package manager creater for minimal applications like PMDMcalc or installing new lightweight apps.

It is built in to PyTermOS, and can be installed on macOS/Linux.

Only thing you need is, Python on macOS and the newest version of Juice for PyTermOS.

## juicy development
JuicyDevelopment is a JuicyService that can upload your apps to Juice.

## juice use
JuiceUse is a service, pre-installed to JuicePackage, for easier use. Like in juice plus [package].

## so much juice
JuicePackage is built in with many features like JuicyDevelopment or JuiceUse, which makes JuicePackage so juicy.

## requirements for juice
python3 or newer

bash/zsh/PyTerm

Linux/PyTermOS(PyTerm)/macOS/ (almost multiplatform)

JuicePackage docs (for understanding the commands)

## and
even though JuicePackage is in development, the SE version is in development too
read more at the [SE version readme](/SE/whatsSE?.md)
### sorry
Juice is still in development, so PyTermOS is. You can contribute, so it will be ready faster.
