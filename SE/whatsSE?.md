# whats se
se means "sideloaded" which means that theres an iOS version in development.
## how to use
JuicePackage SE is an app for macOS, and command line tools are for Linux. PyTermOS is supported if you entered bash, somehow.
### for example (macOSX users)
you install the .dmg
put the app in the applications folder
open it
enter your apple ID
enter the path to the IPA file
the app installes
you start using it
### for example (Linux users)
it comes with juice preinstalled, so you need to install juice only
run it with juiceSE command
it will ask the apple id (password and email)
ask the path to IPA
ask if you wanna proceed: (Y)es or (N)o?
after accepting, the ipa will install
### so
usage is easier, if you're on macOS
but it's still easy to use
thats JuicePackage SE.
